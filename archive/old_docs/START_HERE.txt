========================================
  TWO-STAGE CMOS OP-AMP
  Complete KiCad 9.0 Project
========================================

READY TO OPEN!

Files created:
✓ two_stage_opamp.kicad_pro  (Project file)
✓ two_stage_opamp.kicad_sch  (Schematic)

========================================
HOW TO OPEN:
========================================

METHOD 1: Double-click
-----------------------
Just double-click:
  two_stage_opamp.kicad_pro

KiCad will open automatically!


METHOD 2: From KiCad
-----------------------
1. Open KiCad 9.0
2. File → Open Project
3. Navigate to: C:\Users\Mads2\SPICEPilot\
4. Select: two_stage_opamp.kicad_pro
5. Click Open

========================================
RUNNING THE SIMULATION:
========================================

Once project is open:

1. Click "Schematic Editor" button
   (or the schematic will open automatically)

2. You'll see the complete op-amp circuit:
   - Left: Power supplies
   - Center: Differential amplifier (M2-M5)
   - Right: Output stage (M6-M7)
   - Bottom: SPICE models

3. Press Ctrl+Shift+S
   (or menu: Inspect → Simulator)

4. Click the green ▶ "Run" button

5. After simulation:
   - Right-click plot → "Add Signals"
   - Select "V(vout)"
   - Right-click trace → "Show as: Magnitude (dB)"

6. You'll see the Bode plot!

========================================
WHAT THE SIMULATION SHOWS:
========================================

Frequency Response (AC Analysis):
- DC Gain: ~1.4 dB
- 3dB Bandwidth: ~1.16 MHz
- Unity-Gain Frequency: ~0.71 MHz
- Phase Margin: Good (stable)

========================================
MODIFYING THE CIRCUIT:
========================================

To change component values:
- Double-click any component
- Edit the "Value" field
- Re-run simulation

To change bias:
- Edit Vbias_p (currently 3.5V)
- Edit Vbias_n (currently 1.5V)

To change transistor sizes:
- Scroll to bottom of schematic
- Edit the text with SPICE models
- Change w= and l= parameters

========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING:
========================================

If KiCad says "Can't open":
→ Make sure both files are in same folder:
  - two_stage_opamp.kicad_pro
  - two_stage_opamp.kicad_sch

If simulation doesn't run:
→ Check SPICE log tab for errors

If no signals appear:
→ Make sure simulation completed
→ Look for "Simulation completed" message

========================================

Everything is ready!
Just open: two_stage_opamp.kicad_pro

========================================
