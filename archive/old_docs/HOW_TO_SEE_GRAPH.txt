HOW TO SEE THE GRAPH IN KICAD SIMULATOR
========================================

The simulation RAN successfully (you saw it in the log).
Now you need to PLOT the results!

========================================
STEP-BY-STEP TO GET THE GRAPH:
========================================

In the KiCad Simulator window:

1. RIGHT-CLICK in the empty plot area
   (the big blank space where graph should be)

2. Select "Add Signals..." from menu
   (or click the "Add Signals" button in toolbar)

3. A dialog will open showing available signals

4. Look for and SELECT:
   - v(vout)
   - OR V(vout)
   - (capitalization might vary)

5. Click OK

6. The signal should appear in the plot!

7. To see it as dB (Bode plot):
   - In the left panel, you'll see the signal listed
   - RIGHT-CLICK on "V(vout)" in the signals list
   - Select "Show as" → "Magnitude (dB)"

8. For phase:
   - Add V(vout) again
   - Right-click → "Show as" → "Phase"

========================================
IF YOU DON'T SEE ANY SIGNALS:
========================================

Option A: Check what's available
---------------------------------
1. Look in the SPICE Console/Log tab
2. Scroll through the output
3. Look for node names like:
   - vout
   - n_d2
   - n_d3
   - n_tail

Option B: Use specific node
---------------------------------
Try adding these signals one by one:
- V(vout)
- v(vout)
- vout
- V(n_d3)

Option C: Check the log output
---------------------------------
1. In Simulator window, click "SPICE Console" tab
2. Look for lines that say "No. of Data Rows"
3. Below that, you should see node names
4. Try adding those exact names

========================================
TOOLBAR BUTTONS IN SIMULATOR:
========================================

Look for these icons at the top:

▶ = Run simulation (you already did this)
📊 = Add signals (click this!)
📈 = Show/hide legend
🔍 = Zoom tools

========================================
QUICK TEST:
========================================

After clicking "Add Signals", you should see
a list like this:

Available Signals:
  V(vout)
  V(vdd)
  V(n_d2)
  V(n_d3)
  V(n_tail)
  V(vin_p)
  V(vin_n)
  ... etc

Just select V(vout) and click OK!

========================================
ALTERNATIVE VIEW:
========================================

If you can't get the graph, you can:

1. Check the output in the log
2. Export results to CSV:
   - File → Export Current Plot to CSV

3. Open in Excel/Python to plot

========================================

The simulation WORKED - you just need to
tell KiCad WHICH signal to display!

Right-click the plot area and add V(vout)!
